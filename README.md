1. Create worked with the new features of Disabled, Suspended and Admin by setting their default values to all 0s
2. Login worked by kicking the number of username and pw attempts beyond 3 back to the Welcome screen

3. If a user is an admin, it goes to the Admin console
4. If a user is not an admin, it goes to the chatroom

Awaiting client/server implementation

Once client/server has been implemented, a regular user should see the list of currently logged on in the chatroom
